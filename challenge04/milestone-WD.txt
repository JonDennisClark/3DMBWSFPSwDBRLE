Our project will be a survival based First Person Shooter that we develop in Unity. We want to incorporate
more advanced movement techniques than simply moving around, i.e. jumping, sliding, etc. We also want to
have enemy AI so that there is a dynamic element to playing. The weapons will be dependant on the cards
that the player is holding, which will be shuffled after each "reload".

I will be responsible for coming up with the enemy AI. So far I have researched the basic elements of
creating a game in Unity and now I will need to determine how to do a basic AI using the Unity program.

Rubric
  20 pts: Developing a working AI for enemies
  15 pts: Spent the required time of >= 4 hours
   5 pts: Worked well with the team so that all elements combine
