The `Prototype 2` executable and the `UnityPlayer.dll` file MUST be in the same location for the game to run properly.  
The `Prototype 2` folder contains all files from the prototype which were not too large to be pushed (so very few), but most importantly ccontains all C# scripts used for the game.  
  
  The above comments are still true, but it was nigh impossible to make github agree with our attempts to upload the built executable of the game. As a result, we have uploaded the game to simmer.io at this link https://simmer.io/@WolvWearer/302-final. Note, the game was not originally meant to be a WebGL game, and as such suffers some performance issues in this state. The Quit button, for example, now merely freezes the program until the page is refreshed rather than closing an application.
